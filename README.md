## 🤷 Frequently Asked Questions
1. Why would I use this for?
   > You tell me. Are you a JSON-freak like me? Do you have some JSON or JSON-like data on your phone? Want some extra security? Here ya go!
1. I have the app. Where do I start?
   > First you need to encrypt a file by going to the "Encrypt" tab. The file can be JSON or any other text file. Give it a password and press "Encrypt."
   > Once it is encrypted, you may use the "Decrypt" tab to perform the decryptions going forward. The decryption process is similar and will only select files that you've previously encrypted.
   > Explore the options in the menu button (top-right) as well. The app will timeout and lock after a period of idling.
1. Where are the encrypted files located?
   > Newer versions of Android sequester app-specific files to an isolated folder on your device. Files are inaccessible from other apps.

1. Why can't you delete the original file?
   > Working on it. This requires additional privileges and privacy concerns. There are use cases where the user may want to keep the original file.
